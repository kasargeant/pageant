# PAGEANT: README

## ABOUT

colors.js and colour.js are popular string styling module, but they extend String.prototype. 

chalk.js is another cleaner solution but is rather limited in capability.

terminal-kit is another solution that a full-blown terminal solution... but it's rather heavy-weight.

Pageant is different.  It doesn't try to offer everything.  It just delivers colored and customisable console output.

* Out-the-box - without configuration.
* Via function call or via static config file
* Colored text is composable.
